"""Tests for the history-strip instrument.

The strips were the unmeasured half of the guard stack. Every retry logs a
line; the strips ran silently on every turn, so the only visible evidence of
self-imitation was the fraction that survived as far as the retry path. On
2026-08-01 a five-hour run of poisoned replies in #afternet produced exactly
ONE guard-fire line, which made the load look negligible when it was not — and
a six-month log analysis could measure retries per model but not strips.

``history_strip`` closes that gap. These tests pin the two things that make it
trustworthy: that counting cannot change what the model sees, and that the
line only appears when something was actually removed.

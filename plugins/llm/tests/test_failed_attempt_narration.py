"""Tests for the failed-attempt narration guard.

#afternet on 2026-08-15. ``vibebot draw bunga bunga party`` came back with::

    Second image ready, first failed.
    https://paste.boxlabs.uk/img/img_6a81079496b1b.jpg
    First image failed. Second one ready.

One picture was asked for and one was delivered. The model issued two
generate_image calls in the same assistant message, the provider refused one,
and the retry it performed on its own behalf became the headline — twice, in a
reply short enough that the failure was the only thing visible on the channel
line.

Two fixes, at two altitudes:

* the generate_image short-circuit now fires when EVERY call in the step was a
  draw and AT LEAST ONE delivered, so the narrating step never runs (and the
  turn saves a completion); and
* :func:`_strip_failed_attempt_narration` catches the residue — a step that
  mixed a draw with another tool, where the post-tool text is still needed.

The reply also has to stop poisoning the next turn. ``_is_image_failure``
spares anything carrying an image URL, by design, so this line survived into
history and seeded the same narration on the following draw. Delivering the URL
alone removes the exemplar as well as the noise.

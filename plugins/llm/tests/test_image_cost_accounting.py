"""Tests for image-spend accounting on models LiteLLM cannot price.

Every image model this bot has used is invisible to LiteLLM's cost map —
checked against upstream 1.93.0 and 1.97.0 on 2026-08-16, neither carries a
single grok-imagine entry — so `completion_cost` returns nothing and
IMAGE_COST_PER_IMAGE is the only price there is. Two ways that price was being
lost before it reached the usage table:

* **The tool boundary.** `_draw_for_assistant` knew the cost and had nowhere to
  put it, so nothing recorded it at all. From 2026-04-11, when @draw was
  converted to run through assistant_request and every path to an image started
  going through that callback, until 2026-08-16, every image the bot drew was
  booked at $0.00. The prod usage table shows it plainly: draw rows carry
  `xai/grok-imagine-image-pro` (since renamed -quality) at $0.069 average through 2026-04-11, then switch
  to *chat* model names at ~$0.001 — the text cost of the turn with the image
  cost missing. The fix is a second usage row written by the callback itself,
  under the image model, because a row names exactly one model and the turn
  used two.

* **Refused generations.** A moderated refusal still bills; xAI says so in the
  error (`'usage': {'cost_in_usd_ticks': 200000000}`). Nothing costed those at
  all, on any path. With draws refused better than half the time, that is the
  larger of the two leaks per call.

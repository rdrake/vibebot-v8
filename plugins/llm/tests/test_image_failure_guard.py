"""Tests for the image-failure history guard.

When image generation errors -- the provider's content filter, or a transient
API fault -- the model reports it in a short line. That report is correct for
the turn that produced it, but leaving it in history is what turns one bad
prompt into an unbroken run of refusals: a non-reasoning model reproduces the
sentence verbatim on the next draw request and never calls the tool at all.

Observed in #afternet on 2026-08-01. "draw a tit" was content-moderated by xAI
(a legitimate refusal). The very next message, "draw a cat", came back with the
identical sentence at ``tool_calls=0`` -- the image API was never contacted, so
image generation looked broken when only the first prompt ever was.

None of the sibling guards catch it, each for its own structural reason, so the
regression tests below pin that gap as much as they pin the new guard:
``_is_safety_refusal`` deliberately excludes image refusals,
``_strip_repeated_replies`` never judges a reply under its distinct-word floor,
and ``_strip_degraded`` needs a long passage.

"""Tests for the tool-complaint history guard.

The image-failure guard (``_is_image_failure``) fixed one sentence. It is keyed
on an image noun sitting next to a failure verb, and the model promptly drifted
out of that vocabulary while keeping the behaviour: over five hours in
#afternet on 2026-08-01 the same self-imitation loop restated itself as

    20:07  Image generation failed.            <- the only line the sibling catches
    20:36  The image tool's broken.
    21:59  Tool spat back nothing but silence this time.
    22:13  Tool refused. 420.
    22:17  Tool still giving 420.
    22:29  Tool's still choking on the request.

By the end the bot answered "vibebot give Jordan some bacon" -- a request that
needs no tool at all -- with a tool complaint at ``tool_calls=0``. Chasing the
wording is an arms race, so this guard is keyed on the SHAPE instead: a short
reply, leading with a complaint about the machinery, is a failure report. It is
stripped from history every turn (the report is only ever true of the turn that
produced it), and retried when the invocation never called a tool at all --
because then there is provably nothing for it to be reporting.

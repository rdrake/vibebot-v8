"""Tests for the fabricated-image-URL guard.

The stale-image guard caught the model REPOSTING a real image URL out of
history after generate_image failed. This covers the sibling failure it could
not see: the model skipping the tool entirely and INVENTING a URL.

Observed in #afternet on 2026-08-01, in the same minute as a genuine success:

    20:28:58  draw a wizard         -> paste.boxlabs.uk/img/img_6a6e571adf508.jpg   (20s, real)
    20:29:49  draw rdrake ...       -> irc.rdrake.org/llm/image/<slug>.png          (2s, invented)

The invented URLs 404 -- no such directory, no such files -- and there was no
op=image_generation in the log for either. Every structural check passed them
through, because the old detector only recognised the mint filename shape
(``img_<hex>.<ext>``) and a fabrication does not look minted: findall returned
nothing, so the reply read as clean. Worse, the guard was gated on the image
tool having FAILED, which is exactly what does not happen when the model never
calls it.

So detection matches any image URL and filters by host, and the guard runs
unconditionally. A fabrication is recoverable, so it forces the tool and
retries rather than apologising.

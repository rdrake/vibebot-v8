"""Tests for the reply-guard table itself.

The individual detectors have their own suites; this one pins the properties
the *table* is responsible for, which the six longhand blocks used to encode
implicitly in their own control flow:

* order, because the first guard to fire wins the turn;
* the split around the fabricated-image guard, which rewrites ``content``
  between the two halves and so must keep everything after it downstream;
* fall-through, because an exhausted guard has to yield to the next one
  rather than swallowing the turn.

Behaviour-preservation for the refactor that introduced the table rests on the
existing per-guard suites all still passing; these are the invariants those
suites cannot see.

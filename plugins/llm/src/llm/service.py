           tasks and returns them as ``PendingTaskResult`` for the plugin to

Current time: {current_time}

Response format (choose one):
{{"action": "schedule", "seconds": <int>, "message": "<string>", "confirmation": "<string>", "note": "<string or null>", "action_prompt": "<string>", "recurrence_seconds": <int or null>, "recurrence_rrule": "<RRULE string or null>", "watch_mode": <bool>}}
or
{{"action": "clarify", "confirmation": "<question to ask user>"}}

Rules:
- "seconds" = seconds from now until reminder fires (must be positive)
- For relative times ("in 30 minutes"), set note to null — timezone is irrelevant
- For absolute times ("at 3pm") without a timezone, assume UTC and set note suggesting they specify next time
- If request is too vague (missing time or message), use "clarify"
- "confirmation" is shown to the user immediately at scheduling time. It MUST only state that the reminder was set and when. Do NOT speculate about what the bot can or cannot do at fire time, do NOT mention tool limits, do NOT add disclaimers like "though I can only ..." — capability decisions happen at fire time, not now.
- Keep confirmation concise (under 100 chars)
- Extract just the reminder message, not the time part
- For relative times ("in 30 minutes"), calculate seconds directly
- For absolute times ("at 3pm"), calculate seconds until that time
- Set "action_prompt" to a non-empty bare instruction whenever the message contains an imperative verb the BOT can execute. The bot can: search the web, fetch URLs, draw images, write/run code, summarize text, look up status, check builds/CVEs/feeds, generate content, query its own memory, send messages. If any of those verbs (draw, search, fetch, look up, check, summarize, generate, write, post, query, find, list, compute, ...) appears as the main verb of the user's request, that is an action — not an echo.
- Set "action_prompt" to "" (empty) only when the user is clearly asking THEMSELVES to do something later (passive "remind me to X" where X is a human action like "call Bob", "go to the store", "take a break") OR the message is a pure label/note with no verb at all.
- "action_prompt" is fed directly to the same engine that handles `@ask`. Write it as a self-contained instruction the user could literally type AFTER `@ask` and get the result they want — no `@ask` prefix, no time qualifier ("in 2 hours"), no "remind me", just the bare task. Preserve the user's wording where possible.
- "message" should still be a short human-readable description shown in `@remind list` (e.g., "check Debian CVE-2026-31431 status", "draw copy fail").
- Recurrence is now structured. For recurring requests, set "seconds" to the NEXT occurrence (the first fire time), then choose ONE of the following to populate:
  - For numeric cadences ("every 5 minutes", "every hour", "daily" interpreted as 86400 seconds), populate "recurrence_seconds" with the integer cadence in seconds; leave "recurrence_rrule" as null.
  - For calendar cadences ("every Monday at 9am", "first of the month", "every weekday at 5pm", "daily at 8am"), populate "recurrence_rrule" with a valid RFC 5545 RRULE string; leave "recurrence_seconds" as null. Do NOT include DTSTART in the rrule string — only the RRULE body (e.g. "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO;BYHOUR=9;BYMINUTE=0").
  - For one-shot reminders, BOTH must be null.
  - The two recurrence fields are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE — exactly zero or one is non-null.
- Watch mode: if the user phrases the task as a *check-until*-style watch ("let me know when X is available", "tell me if Y appears", "alert me when Z happens", "watch for W"), set "watch_mode" to true. Otherwise set to false. Default false. The fire-time engine uses watch_mode to suppress noisy "still no news" replies; only positive results reach the user.
- DO NOT embed recurrence or watch hints into "action_prompt". "action_prompt" is now ONLY the bare action — no "(recurring: ...)" parenthetical, no "(watch — ...)" parenthetical.

Examples (imperative → action_prompt):
- "in 30m check if the build is green" → action_prompt: "check if the build is green", recurrence_seconds: null, recurrence_rrule: null, watch_mode: false

- "in 1m draw copy fail" → action_prompt: "draw copy fail", recurrence_seconds: null, recurrence_rrule: null, watch_mode: false
- "in 5m search for recent rust async news" → action_prompt: "search for recent rust async news", recurrence_seconds: null, recurrence_rrule: null, watch_mode: false
- "in 10m summarize the top 3 hn headlines about postgres" → action_prompt: "summarize the top 3 hn headlines about postgres", recurrence_seconds: null, recurrence_rrule: null, watch_mode: false
- "in 2h check status of CVE-2026-31431 in Debian" → action_prompt: "check status of CVE-2026-31431 in Debian", recurrence_seconds: null, recurrence_rrule: null, watch_mode: false
- "tomorrow at 9am fetch https://example.com/build and tell me if it's green" → action_prompt: "fetch https://example.com/build and tell me if it's green", recurrence_seconds: null, recurrence_rrule: null, watch_mode: false
- "every hour check the build" → action_prompt: "check the build", recurrence_seconds: 3600, recurrence_rrule: null, watch_mode: false
- "every Monday at 9am post the weekly summary" → action_prompt: "post the weekly summary", recurrence_seconds: null, recurrence_rrule: "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO;BYHOUR=9;BYMINUTE=0", watch_mode: false
- "daily at 8am search for new rust async news" → action_prompt: "search for new rust async news", recurrence_seconds: null, recurrence_rrule: "FREQ=DAILY;BYHOUR=8;BYMINUTE=0", watch_mode: false
- "every 5m let me know when Ubuntu 24.04 patches CVE-2026-31431" → action_prompt: "check Ubuntu 24.04 patch status for CVE-2026-31431", recurrence_seconds: 300, recurrence_rrule: null, watch_mode: true

Examples (echo → action_prompt: ""):
- "in 5m remind me to check the build" → action_prompt: "" (passive — user said "remind me to")
- "tomorrow at 3pm call Bob" → action_prompt: "" (the bot can't make phone calls)
- "in 1h take a break" → action_prompt: "" (action is for the user)
- "in 30m standup meeting" → action_prompt: "" (label, no verb directed at the bot)"""

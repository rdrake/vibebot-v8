    servers with account-tag + extended-join the WHO is redundant — both
    queries serialize behind connection registration and meaningfully delay

    The patch always drops MODE +b and conditionally drops the WHO (gated by

    because Limnoria reads channel-mode state in many places.

    Re-patches on every plugin __init__ so the closure tracks the current
    LLM instance after a reload. Cheap; the patch is global to all Irc
    instances, so a multi-instance LLM plugin would have the last-init
    instance win — not a real concern for this single-plugin deployment.

        invalid-command callbacks that Limnoria runs **synchronously** inside
        ``Irc.feedMsg`` on the socket driver's thread. That driver only
        flushes its outbound queue *after* the callback returns:
        ``supybot.drivers.Socket._read`` loops ``feedMsg`` over every received
        line, then calls ``_sendIfMsgs`` once at the end. Running the
        multi-second LLM generation inline therefore pins the driver — the
        ``+typing=active`` TAGMSG that ``_begin_typing`` enqueues cannot leave
        the socket until generation finishes, so "is composing" only shows up
        at the same instant as the reply. (Moving ``_begin_typing`` earlier in
        the call chain — already done — can't fix this; the bottleneck is the
        blocked flush, not call ordering.)

        Explicit ``@``-prefixed commands don't lag because Limnoria already
        runs them in a ``CommandThread`` (see ``callbacks.py``), which frees
        the driver to flush right away — that's why ``@ask`` shows typing

        daemon ``SupyThread`` runs the dispatch, the callback returns at once,
        and the driver flushes the typing TAGMSG on its next loop iteration.
        LLM concurrency stays bounded by the ``_llm_executor.permit()`` inside
        ``_ask_impl`` (identical to the command path), so this unblocks the
        driver without adding new concurrency.

        Deliberately NOT routed through ``_llm_executor.submit``: that worker
        acquires the concurrency semaphore itself, and ``_ask_impl`` acquires
        it again via ``permit()``, so a submitted dispatch would double-acquire
        and deadlock once the pool fills — ``submit`` guards against exactly
        this nesting with ``RecursiveSubmitError``.

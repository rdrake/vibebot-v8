"""Global concurrency cap for all LLM I/O in the plugin.

Both command-path and background callers funnel through here so a
single ``maxConcurrentLLMCalls`` knob bounds outbound provider load
regardless of which thread originated the call.

Two surfaces:

* ``permit()`` — context manager. Use from a thread that already
  exists (Limnoria CommandThread). Acquires/releases one slot from
  the bounded semaphore.
* ``submit(label, fn, *args, **kw) -> Future`` — runs ``fn`` on a
  pool worker after acquiring a slot. Use from the main IRC thread
  inside a ``schedule.addEvent`` shim so the main thread returns
  immediately.

Workers must NEVER call :meth:`submit` recursively — saturating the
pool would deadlock. ``RecursiveSubmitError`` is raised at runtime as
a guardrail. Note: the guard fires at ``submit()`` call time (outside
the worker function body), not inside the worker wrapper. Keep it
that way — putting it inside the wrapper would not catch the case
where ``submit`` is called from worker context but never executes.

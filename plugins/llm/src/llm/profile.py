"""Single source of truth for per-mode chat-loop dispatch configuration.

This module owns:

- The five **chat-loop profile identifiers** (``PROFILE_CHAT``,
  ``PROFILE_CODE``, ``PROFILE_DRAW``, ``PROFILE_VERSE``,
  ``PROFILE_REMIND_ACTION``) that route requests through
  ``service.assistant_completion``.
- The :class:`Profile` frozen dataclass that bundles every per-mode fact
  for one of those routes: which Limnoria registry keys hold the model
  and API key, which ``prompts.PROMPTS`` key supplies the framework
  system prompt, which registry key holds the channel-overridable
  personality overlay, the max-output-tokens cap, and the
  force-search-on-explicit opt-in.
- The :data:`PROFILES` registry mapping each identifier to its Profile.

Tools are *not* a field on :class:`Profile`. Tool visibility is a
many-to-many relation owned by ``assistant.ToolSpec.visible_in``;
consumers should call ``assistant.get_tools_for_profile(profile.id)``
directly. This keeps a single source of truth for visibility and avoids
a back-import from ``profile`` to ``assistant``.

Lookup pattern::

    from llm.profile import PROFILES, PROFILE_CHAT
    profile = PROFILES[route_profile]  # route_profile is one of the IDs
    model_key = profile.model_setting
    prompt_text = prompts.PROMPTS[profile.prompt_id].format(bot_nick=...)

"""Limnoria → LLM tool bridge.

Exposes loaded Limnoria plugin commands to the LLM as a single
``run_limnoria_command`` tool. Enforces a layered denial model:

1. Hard-coded ``DENY_PLUGINS`` / ``DENY_COMMANDS`` (this module).
2. Operator-set ``bridgeAllowedPlugins`` (per-channel registry).
3. Limnoria's own capability system via ``checkCommandCapability``.

See docs/plans/archive/2026-05-02-limnoria-tool-bridge-plan.md for the full design.

"""Atlassian Statuspage v2 API model — pure, no supybot imports.

Fetching, strict parsing, incident-lifecycle classification, sanitisation of
third-party prose, and deterministic line rendering. Kept free of Limnoria
imports so it unit-tests against dicts with no IRC scaffolding, and free of
``llm.service`` imports so there is no import cycle (``service`` and
``plugin`` both consume this module).

The API contract is tenant-agnostic: every Statuspage-hosted service serves
the same ``/api/v2/summary.json``. The genericity lives here, in functions
that take a base URL, rather than in the config or the tool schema.

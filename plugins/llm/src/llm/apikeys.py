"""Provider-scoped API key resolution.

A key is a property of which provider is being paid, not of which channel or
which role asked. This module maps a model identifier to its provider and then
to a single environment variable, so the key is always anchored to the model
actually being called.

Pure and dependency-light on purpose: no plugin, no service, no Limnoria
registry. That keeps it unit-testable and keeps key resolution out of
``service.py``.

    Handlers, not loggers: a logger's filters run only for records that
    originate on it, and propagation to an ancestor runs the ancestor's
    *handlers*, not its *filters*. This plugin logs through at least ten loggers
    across two hierarchies (``supybot.plugins.LLM.*`` and ``llm.verse.*``), so
    per-logger installation would cover whichever two we happened to name.

    In this deployment, only the ``supybot`` hierarchy actually has a handler
    attached anywhere (supybot's own startup does that); nothing in this repo
    attaches one to root or to ``llm`` (``grep addHandler plugins/llm/src/`` —
    no hits). So an ``llm.verse.*`` record propagates all the way up without
    finding a single handler, and Python's fallback path takes over:
    ``logging.lastResort`` — a bare stderr handler that belongs to no logger —
    handles it instead, unfiltered, straight into ``docker logs``. Filtering
    ``logging.lastResort`` here closes that path regardless of whether a real
    handler ever gets attached to ``llm`` later.

    ``import litellm`` additionally creates three loggers of its own —
    ``LiteLLM``, ``LiteLLM Proxy``, ``LiteLLM Router`` — each with its own
    ``StreamHandler(stderr)`` attached directly, at effective level WARNING.
    A logger's own handler runs before propagation to any ancestor, so a
    record on one of these reaches stderr (and therefore ``docker logs``)
    through that handler regardless of what is or isn't attached to root,
    ``supybot`` or ``llm``. They are covered by name below for that reason,
    not because they sit in either hierarchy.

    Handlers created later — supybot adds per-plugin file handlers when
    ``individualLogfiles`` is true; prod has it false — are not covered. Calling
    this again picks them up.

    Returns the number of handlers newly filtered, for the startup log line.

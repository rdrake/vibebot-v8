# Reminders

Set reminders in natural language. When the time comes, the bot either echoes your text back or, if you asked it to *do* something, runs the task at fire time.

!!! tip "Natural language"
    Where an operator has enabled it, you can *create* reminders and scheduled tasks by talking to the bot: "VibeBot, remind me in 2 hours to check the build". Listing and cancelling stay on the `@remind` command either way. The channel key is `supybot.plugins.LLM.pendingTasksEnabled`, and it's off by default. `@remind` always works.

## `remind`

**Usage:** `@remind <natural language time and message>`

```
@remind in 30 minutes check the build
@remind at 5pm review the pull request
@remind tomorrow at 9am standup meeting
```

The bot parses times such as "in 30 minutes", "at 5 p.m.", and "tomorrow at 9 a.m." An absolute time with no time zone is read as UTC, and the confirmation says so — name the zone if you meant something else.

A reminder has to fire between 10 seconds and 7 days from now, the text after `@remind` is capped at 500 characters, and you can hold 25 pending reminders at a time.

## Action reminders

If your reminder asks the bot to *perform a task* (look something up, check a status, fetch a URL, summarise something), the bot runs the task as a fresh AI query when the timer fires. The query has the bot's full tool surface: web search, URL fetch, code, drawing, memory, and nested reminders.

```
@remind in 2 hours check the status of CVE-2026-31431 in Debian 12 and 13
@remind in 30 minutes check if https://example.com/build is green
@remind tomorrow at 9 a.m. summarize the top 3 HN headlines about Rust
```

Action reminders appear marked **`[auto]`** in `@remind list`, so you can tell them apart from plain echo reminders.

Phrase one as a watch — "every 10 minutes let me know when the mirror has 24.04" — and the bot stays quiet on every fire that finds nothing. Only a positive result reaches the channel, so a watch that never speaks is working, not broken.

"Remind me to" phrasing, where *you* do the thing, stays a plain echo:

```
@remind in 5 minutes remind me to check the build   # echo only
@remind tomorrow at 3 p.m. call Bob                 # echo only
```

The parser leans towards action: any imperative it can carry out — check, search, fetch, draw, summarise — becomes an action reminder. It stays an echo only when the subject is plainly you, or when there is no verb at all. If it misclassifies, rephrase.

## Recurring reminders and scheduled tasks

For repeating work, ask in plain English:

```
VibeBot, every 2 hours check the status of #1234 and ping me if it changed
VibeBot, every weekday at 9 a.m. summarize the overnight CVE feed
```

Anything that needs tools at fire time becomes a [scheduled task](scheduled-tasks.md). Plain echo reminders also recur: `@remind every Friday at 5 p.m. switch laundry over` schedules a chain of one-shot reminders that re-arm themselves, up to 50 times, before you have to set them again.

None of it can be listed or cancelled by talking to the bot — creating is all chat can do. Everything you own, reminders and scheduled tasks alike, comes back through `@remind list` and `@remind delete`, below.

Things to know:

- **Action reminders count against your `@ask` rate limit.** If you're over the limit when one fires, the bot delivers your original text as a plain reminder with a note, and makes no API call.
- **No elevated capabilities at fire time.** Even if an owner or admin scheduled the action, it runs without those rights.
- **A fired scheduled task cannot schedule another one.** The depth cap is one. A recurring reminder also loses `set_reminder` at fire time, so it cannot double-book against the scheduler's own re-arm.
- **Recurring chains cap at 50 fires.** After that, re-arm the reminder.
- **Scheduled tasks need an authenticated account.** Log in to your network account first.
- **Conversational scheduling is per channel.** The plain-English forms in this section need `pendingTasksEnabled` on that channel; `@remind` does not.

## Listing and cancelling

```
@remind list                # your reminders and tasks, with IDs
@remind delete abc1         # cancel one (del also works)
@remind delete abc1 def2    # cancel several
@remind clear               # cancel everything you own
```

`list` marks action reminders `[auto]` and [scheduled tasks](scheduled-tasks.md) `[task]`. Delete either kind by the id `list` shows it under.

`@remind clear` cancels every reminder and scheduled task you own. It says what went, so `Cleared 2 reminders and 1 scheduled task.` is your receipt.

## Delivery

The bot delivers a reminder to the channel where you set it, or by private message if you set it by PM. If the bot was offline when a reminder came due, it delivers the reminder shortly after it comes back. A reminder that came due more than 24 hours before the bot returned is dropped, not delivered.

## Owner admin

Bot owners can list, delete, and clear other users' reminders and scheduled tasks:

```
@remind admin list someone
@remind admin del someone abc1
@remind admin clear someone
```

Everyone else receives a permission error.

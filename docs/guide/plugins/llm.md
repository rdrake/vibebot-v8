# LLM plugin

The LLM plugin is VibeBot's main AI surface. It provides
natural-language chat, code and image generation, illustrated stories,
persistent memory, and reminders. It also runs scheduled agentic
tasks, hosts a persistent roleplay world (the verse), and carries a
curated bridge that lets the model call other Limnoria plugins as
tools.

## Command families

| Family | Commands | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Core AI | `@ask`, `@code`, `@draw`, `@story` | Chat with vision, code with HTTP links, images, illustrated pages. |
| Memory | `@forget`, `@memories`, `@instruct` | Volatile context, durable facts, persistent instructions. |
| Reminders | `@remind` | Natural-language reminders with recurring support. |
| Accounting | `@usage` | Per-account and per-channel API usage. |
| Verse (user) | `@verseopt`, `@rp`, `@verse`, `@look`, `@who`, `@avatar` | Opt in, roleplay, inspect the scene, set a persona. |
| Verse (editor) | `@canon`, `@versedit` | Curate durable canon. Requires `llm.verse.edit`. |
| Verse (GM) | `@versedump`, `@versepurge`, `@versecompact` | Inspect, wipe, and compact a channel's verse. Requires `llm.verse.gm`. |

See the [command reference](../reference/commands.md) for full syntax
and capability requirements, and the
[configuration guide](../operator/configuration.md) for every registry
key.

`@ask`, `@code` and `@draw` also work through plain language: mention
the bot by name or send it a PM. `@story` does not — an illustrated page
comes from the command, or from an explicit illustrate cue in a verse
channel with `verseStorybookEnabled` on. Memory, Reminders and Accounting are
command-only, with two exceptions — the model can save a memory, and
where `pendingTasksEnabled` is on it can set a reminder or schedule a
task. Listing and cancelling go through `@remind list`, `del` and
`clear`, which cover your reminders and your scheduled tasks alike.
[Bridge tools](../reference/bridge-tools.md) lists the tool surface each
route sees.

## Capabilities

Limnoria capabilities gate the AI and verse commands: `llm.ask` (`@ask`,
`@forget`), `llm.code`, `llm.draw` (also covers `@story`), `llm.verse`
(`@rp`, `@verseopt`, `@verse`, `@look`, `@who`), `llm.verse.edit`
(`@canon`, `@versedit`), and `llm.verse.gm` (`@versedump`,
`@versepurge`, `@versecompact`).

`@memories`, `@instruct`, `@remind`, `@usage`, and `@avatar` carry no
capability of their own. The paths that reach past your own data check
inline instead: `owner` for `@memories <nick>` and `@remind admin`,
`admin` for a bare `@usage` by PM. Owner and admin accounts bypass rate limits.

## Concurrency model

Every blocking LLM call goes through `LLMExecutor` (in `executor.py`),
which combines a `BoundedSemaphore` and a `ThreadPoolExecutor`. This
design:

- caps total in-flight LLM I/O with
  `supybot.plugins.LLM.maxConcurrentLLMCalls` (default 16),
- keeps the IRC main thread responsive, because no `litellm.*` call can
  block it directly, and
- shares one shutdown gate, so plugin reloads drain in-flight work
  cleanly.

The global `@usage` report — a bare `@usage` by PM, admin only —
appends an `executor: running/queued/max` field for tuning.

## Storage

Persistent state lives in a single SQLite database managed by
`persistence.py`. All writes go through the `_write_txn` context
manager, so a failure mid-update rolls back rather than leaving partial
state. Tables cover memories, reminders, scheduled tasks, conversation
snapshots, and per-account usage. Each verse-enabled channel gets its
own SQLite store under `data/verse/`.
